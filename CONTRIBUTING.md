# Contributing guidelines

* Create a directory for your concept.
* Keep the files of the topic local to the directory.
* Try to use CDN for CSS/JS dependencies instead of putting them in repository.
* One of the viz is created using (`material design`)[https://getmdl.io/]  for `grid layout`. However, this can be replaced now with [`CSS Grids`](http://learncssgrid.com/).
* Better use `master` branch for `github-pages`. There isn't anything to be separated in `gh-pages` branch.
* It's good to keep all visualizations consistent in terms of design. However, remember that each topic requires different handling of available screen space and layout.
* Please discuss the design/outline of what you are making before starting to code. Illustrations/sketches would help.
* Including a help text/links to understand the underlying concepts would be a bonus.
